**TIP**: If you try to connect from Home Assistant Dashboard to Home Assistant and your authentication fails, try authenticating again from an ***incognito browser window***, so you are not burdened with expired session cookies! You will be prompted with a Home Assistant login window, and if logging in successfully, redirected to the Home Assistant Dashboard successfully.
